# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to document how public dataset was download from TCGA that will be used for demonstrating tidyomics package.

The full website of The Cancer Genome Atlas Program can be found: https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## tidyomics is still in development for bioconductor version 3.18. Therefore, I will install and load packages needed for the demo separately for now. This will be fixed at later date.

library(tidybulk)

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
